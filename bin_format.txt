<alignment: 1b>
<start>//no byte number implies the number of bytes in alignment
//start is the offset to the first block

//block format: <major: 1b><minor: a-1b><length><data: ?b>
    //major type: the overall format of the data (text, table, span, data, etc.)
    //minor type: the specefic block type (any of the major types, platform, etc.)
//symbol table format: <size><string: ?b><index>
//block types:
.symspn //span symbol table, table: span
.span //span: span 
.symtbl //table: text
.text //text: text
.platsym //table: platform
.platform //span: platform
//etc...

//instruction format: (instructions are not alignment sized!)<opcode: 1b><mod: 2b><displ?><displ?><size: 1b><op1><op2>
//there are (alignment/4)*8 number of registers available at any time with 4 types, r: general, a: argument, f: floating point, and mm: vector (may be mapped to general registers if simd is not available) they are also variable width, (down to 1 bit) which is defined by the 'size' byte.
//for example if alignment is 2 bytes then the format for registers would be <r: 4bits><a: 4bits><f: 4bits><mm: 4bits> which means there are 128 registers (the register width is defined by size, where max width is alignment)
//operands can be larger than alignment depending on 'size' (which must be a power of 2)
//if they are larger than they are split among the alignment size

//mod format: first byte: type of data for registers (register, register deref, pointer, constant)
//second byte: other flags:
//bit 0: has displacement (op1)
//1: displ (op2)
//2: SIB
//3: SIB
//4-7: not yet assigned
